There is no programming language that is equally fast at solving problems in any of these areas. So it’s important to understand that any lists of the best programming languages are subjective and usually based on how popular, versatile, and comfortable the language is.\nContent.\n What are programming languages? Where are programming languages used? The top 5 programming languages currently in use.  **What are programming languages?\nA programming language is a set of formal rules by which programs are written. A normal language is needed to communicate with people, but a programming language is needed to communicate with a computer. Like any natural language, it has a vocabulary - words, functions and operators - from which expressions are composed according to syntax rules. They have a clear, well-defined meaning, understandable to a computer - semantics.\n**Where are programming languages used?\nThe uses of programming languages are very different. They depend on the area where the user wants to use them. For each area, there are “different” programming languages. Generally speaking, programming languages are used in web programming, game development, android development, Operating Systems development, software development, neural networks and data analysis.\n**Top 5 programming languages currently\n1. JavaScript language.\n Don\u0026#39;t confuse it with Java - they are different and totally different languages. JavaScript is used for graphics, mobile and web applications, and browser-based operating systems. It\u0026#39;s very versatile and easy to learn.  2. The Python language.\n Python is easy to learn and is often used to teach children programming, such as at the Skysmart online school. Python programs are close to a natural language, so it\u0026#39;s great as a first language for a beginning programmer. It is a very common language and a large number of projects have been implemented in it. Python is used extensively at Google and much of the source code for YouTube is written in it. It\u0026#39;s also often used in creating robot machines. The strengths of Python are its modularity and its ability to integrate with other languages, while the downsides are its slow speed and high memory consumption.  3. Java language.\n A general-purpose programming language that consistently ranks high in popularity ratings. Applications in Java can run on any computer, for this purpose a virtual Java-machine is created. Mobile applications for the Android operating system are actively being developed in Java. Successful projects such as RuneScape, Yahoo, Amazon, eBay and LinkedIn are written in Java. Disadvantages of Java are slow programs and high RAM consumption.  4. C# language.\n The name of the language reads \u0026#34;C Sharp\u0026#34;. It was developed in 1998-2001 within Microsoft for creating applications. C# belongs to the family of languages with C-like syntax, of which it is closest to C++ and Java. That is why C# has a rather complex syntax, which is considered a disadvantage. Compared to C and C++, C# has safe code. C# is dozens of times slower than C.  *5. rnr language.\n Widely used for creating web applications, leading in applications for creating dynamic websites. PHP has undergone a rapid evolution and has become popular among programmers. However, it is often criticized by programmers for its inconsistent syntax.  Conclusion.\nThus, programming languages are very diverse and exist as long as the purposes for which they are used are relevant. There are now thousands of programming languages used for their purposes, with a large number of people working on them.\n","date":1654167044,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1654167044,"objectID":"69f0081ed3b04a7a048613ad31bbd104","permalink":"https://parfenovaee.github.io/post/language/","publishdate":"2022-06-02T13:50:44+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/language/","section":"post","summary":"Introduction.\nThere are a huge number of directions in IT: from creating games and applications to developing robots that completely replace human labor.

Where is scientific programming used The languages of scientific programming  R Python Julia    **What is scientific programming?\nScience programming is a highly oriented programming style for scientific calculations. It is distinguished from other types of programming by the ultimate correctness and stability of the final product, strict separation of scientific and interface parts, individuality of algorithms, and prevalence of efficiency over universality.\n**Where is scientific programming applied? Scientific programming is at the heart of all modern global research. All advanced technologies, from quantum computers to space programs, would not be possible without experts in science programming who can provide scientists with a reliable and accurate tool for making discoveries.\nA number of fields of science are directly dependent on the level of development of scientific programming. For example, unmanned vehicles, “smart” systems of urban and agricultural management, stock exchanges; robotics, genetic engineering, artificial intelligence, surpassing human capabilities, are waiting for their fulfillment.\nScientific programming languages\nDifferent fields may use different existing programming languages, but in this article I want to talk about three.\n1. R\nR, which is a direct descendant of the older S programming language, was released way back in 1995 and has been getting better and better ever since. Written in languages such as C and Fortran, it is now supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing. An excellent set of high-quality, open-source, subject-oriented packages. R has packages available for almost every quantitative and statistical application imaginable. This includes neural networks, nonlinear regression, phylogenetics, building complex charts, graphs, and much, much more. Along with the basic setup, we are given the option to install extensive built-in functions and methods as an add-on. R is a powerful language with a huge variety of statistical and visualization applications and its open source nature has gathered a large following of developers. It is because of its effectiveness for initial purposes that this programming language has been able to achieve widespread popularity.\n2. Python.\nPython is one of the most popular programming languages at the moment. It has a simple syntax and a variety of different libraries and frameworks to help achieve the desired task.\nPython is a good option for data science purposes, and this is true for both entry-level and advanced data science jobs. Much of data science is centered around the ETL (extract-transform-load) process. This feature makes Python an ideal programming language for such purposes.\n*3. Julia\nReleased just over 5 years ago, Julia impressed the world of computational methods. The language achieved such popularity because several large organizations, including some in the financial industry, almost immediately began using it for their purposes. Julia is a compiled JIT (“just-in-time”) language that achieves good performance. It is a fairly simple language, with dynamic typing and scripting capabilities of an interpreted language such as Python. Julia was designed to do numerical analysis, it can also be considered as a general-purpose programming language. Of course, this language has its shortcomings, the main one being its youth. This language doesn’t have enough software packages yet, but in a few years it will be able to compete with its main competitors.\nConclusion\nScientific programming and the languages with which it can be handled are gaining unprecedented popularity because of the progress that is being made in our society. It allows scientists to advance technology and transform our world into the “world of the future.”\n","date":1653331945,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653331945,"objectID":"505f1926928104c1ffdf04557ad3e744","permalink":"https://parfenovaee.github.io/post/programming/","publishdate":"2022-05-23T21:52:25+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/programming/","section":"post","summary":"Introduction.\nIn this article we will talk about scientific programming and what languages are best for science work.\nContent.\n What is scientific programming?

(e.g. HTML) Originally created by John Gruber and Aaron Schwartz in 2004, whose goal was to create a lightweight markup language that was as readable and publishable as possible. The first Markdown implementation was written by Gruber, in Perl, but a number of third-party implementations have since appeared\n** Reasons to use Markdown**\n  It’s very easy to write text without frills, you can quickly get your docs ready for publication without any complicated layout.\n  Creating a blog or website to host texts with a concise design.\n  Beautiful messages on WhatsApp or Telegram.\n  writing documentation for your project on GitHub. All of these cases have one thing in common - to make a minimal text layout so that it looks neat and can be read without special programs.\n  Markdown Syntax\nThis section will give you a quick tutorial on how to use Markdown but not all the examples you will find here.\nMarkdown headings use a grid. They have five levels (five dimensions). One grid is level one (the largest heading); five grids are five levels (the smallest heading).\nYou can select words or text with an asterisk (*).One asterisk on each side of the word (text) to be selected is italicized; Two asterisks are bold; Three asterisks are bold italicized.\nTo cross out the text, you must put two squiggles (~) next to it.\nNumbered lists are done with numbers and a dot, and the numbers do not have to be put in order. That is even if you put 1, 5, 10, the list will end up with numbers in order. To make a bulleted list, you need to put a dash. Internal lists are made with the help of two “Tab”.\nBlocks of citations are created using the symbol “\u0026gt;”.\nTo insert a link, you need this syntax:\n[hyperlink text](the URL or filename to which the link is given)\nA picture can be inserted like this, but with an exclamation mark:\n![Figure name](link to image)\nSummary.\nThe Markdown markup language is very useful when the user needs to quickly produce concise text.

You’ll learn about git, how it works, and what you need to do to get started.\nContents.\n What is a version control system Where version control systems are used What git is and how it works Working with Git A critique of git  **What is a version control system?\nA version control system (also defined as “version control system”, from Version Control System, VCS or Revision Control System) is software to facilitate working with changing information. Version control system allows you to store several versions of the same document, to return to earlier versions if necessary, to find out who made this or that change and many other things.\n**Where are version control systems used?\nSuch systems are most commonly used in software development to store the source code of the program being developed. However, they can also be successfully applied in other areas where large numbers of continuously changing electronic documents are handled. In particular, version control systems are used in Computer Aided Design Systems, usually as part of Product Data Management (PDM) systems. Version control is used in Software Configuration Management Tools.\n**What is git and how does it work?\nGit is the absolute leader in popularity among modern version control systems. It is a developed project with active support and open source. The git system was originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds - the creator of the Linux operating system kernel. Git is used for version control in a huge number of software development projects, both commercial and open source. The system is used by many professional software developers. It works perfectly on different operating systems and can be used with many integrated development environments (IDEs). Version control allows you to see changes at any stage of development and go back to any point. But that’s not quite the case. Changes are saved as commits. In Russian, it’s a commit. You make an initial commit to save the initial state of the project, and then for each change. This works like a snapshot of the state.\nIn addition, git allows you to send data to a remote server. Not only the finished version is sent, but all of the snapshots are sent, so anyone on the team can see the history of changes. Each snapshot should have a comment, so it’s easier to work with git and make it easier to understand.\nDevelopment in git is focused on providing high performance, security and flexibility of the distributed system.\nWorking with git\nGetting started with git requires a few steps. First, you’ll need to create a GitHub account. Next, set up and configure any features and options you may need via a terminal. The next step is to create a remote repository (or clone it) and connect the system to it. Basically, git is ready to go. You can move the files you need locally (on the system) to the correct directories and write commands that coordinate the local repository. The commands are: - git add . - save changes to the current directory; -git commut - explain changes; - git push - send to the central repository. There is one other command that is better to run before the previous three. This is the git pull command, which loads changes made by someone else (or from another system).\nSummary.\nGit has often been criticized for being difficult to learn because some terms may be unfamiliar to newcomers and others may have different meanings. This being said, git is a very powerful system and offers many great features. It will take some time to learn, but the skills learned will help team members work much faster.\n","date":1651856131,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651856131,"objectID":"b51c39c0ac0ec5a38bb139cda30bb055","permalink":"https://parfenovaee.github.io/post/git/","publishdate":"2022-05-06T19:55:31+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/git/","section":"post","summary":"Introduction.\nThis post will introduce you to the term “version control system”.

To gain practical skills in using commands to work with files and directories, managing processes (and jobs), checking disk usage, and maintaining the file system.  During this work, I studied the sr and mv commands in detail, remembered the cat, touch,mkdir commands. I also learned what permissions are and how to modify them with the command chmod. Using the man command I learned more about the thermal commands.\nLaboratory Work №6\nThe topic of the next lab work was “Finding Files. Redirecting I/O. View running processes”.\nPurpose of work: getting acquainted with the tools of file search and text data filtering. Gaining practical skills: on managing processes (and tasks), checking disk usage and maintaining file systems.\nThe lab work helped me learn about I/O streams and how to handle them (for example, redirecting the standard output stream (ls) to the file I needed). Also I learnt how to use the find and grep commands, to run background processes, to get information about them and to eliminate them with the kill command.\nAlso, during the last week, I have continued to learn C++ programming language and started to learn a new one which I have never worked with before - Python.\nThus, during the past week I have learned different Linux terminal commands that allow me to work with files and continued to develop my programming skills.\n","date":1651855786,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651855786,"objectID":"d087a750756be4d27c1237ab5e18641a","permalink":"https://parfenovaee.github.io/post/%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%8F-1-%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8F/","publishdate":"2022-05-06T19:49:46+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%8F-1-%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8F/","section":"post","summary":"My week was full and productive.
